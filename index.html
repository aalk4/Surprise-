                <p>Sadly, I didn't think this code up from scratch cause I know basically nothing about HTML, but I did write it entirely so hopefuly that makes up for that until I get better.

                    In the past few months that I've gotten to know you, I've learnt about how kind and sweet you are; So this is my attempt to put a smile on your face, 
                    and hopefully make your day a little bit better. I hope all your wishes come true, and I'm looking forward to celebrating every bithday to come :D</p>
